   POLK CITY AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
   BUSINESS POLICY CENTER, CONTENT FILE

   This is the only file you need to edit to update the site.
   You do not need to touch index.html, styles.css, or app.js.

   HOW TO UPDATE
   1. Change reviewedOn below to today's date.
   2. Add, edit, or delete entries in the ENTRIES list.
   3. Save. If you are using GitHub, commit the change.
      The site rebuilds itself within about a minute.

   WRITING RULES FOR THIS PAGE
   - Write for a busy shop owner, not a lawyer.
   - Short sentences. One idea each.
   - If you have to use a technical word, add it to the GLOSSARY below.
   - No dashes in the middle of sentences. Use a period and start again.

   RULES THAT WILL SAVE YOU A HEADACHE
   - Every entry needs a unique "id". Use lowercase words with dashes.
     The id becomes the entry's web address, so it is how you link
     straight to one item from Facebook or an email.
   - Once an entry is published, do not change its id. That would break
     any link already shared.
   - Keep quotes balanced. If the page goes blank after an edit, you have
     almost certainly got a stray quote or a missing comma.

   MEMBER REFERRALS

   Chamber members who do a particular kind of work, shown inside the entry
   where someone is most likely to need them. This is the referral benefit
   in practice: a member gets named at the exact moment a question comes up.

   THREE RULES. These are not suggestions.

   1. ALL OR NONE. If you list one accountant, you list every member who
      does that work. Picking favorites is how a chamber loses members.
      If you are not willing to list all of them, list none and point at
      the full directory instead.

   2. ALPHABETICAL, ALWAYS. The list renders in the order you type it, so
      type it alphabetically. Do not order by tier, by who asked, or by
      who you like. Someone will notice.

   3. UPDATE IT WHEN MEMBERSHIP CHANGES. A member who joins and does not
      get added has a real complaint. A member who lapses and stays listed
      is worse, because the chamber is now vouching for a non-member.

   Leave a list empty and nothing renders. That is the safe default, and
   it is where this ships until the board approves the names.
   ========================================================================== */

   ARCHIVING, AND WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER DELETE AN ENTRY

   Once you have shared a link to an entry on Facebook or in an email, that
   link needs to keep working forever. Deleting the entry breaks it, exactly
   the same way renaming the id would.

   So when something is no longer current, do not delete it. Add:

       archived: true,

   The entry then disappears from its section, from the counts, and from
   search, but the link still works. Anyone who follows an old link sees the
   item with a clear notice that it is no longer current. Archived items are
   also listed together on the Words and Sources page.

    body: `
      <p>A federal tax law signed in July 2025 rewrote several rules that matter to small businesses. Most took effect for the 2025 tax year, with more kicking in for 2026. The short version of what changed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Full expensing of equipment came back.</strong> You can deduct 100% of the cost of qualifying equipment in the year you put it into service, rather than a little each year. This was in the middle of being phased out. It was restored.</li>
        <li><strong>The Section 179 limits went way up.</strong> This is the other way to write off equipment immediately. The ceiling is far above anything a typical Polk City business would hit, which effectively means the limit is no longer the constraint.</li>
        <li><strong>The pass-through deduction was made permanent.</strong> If you file as a sole proprietor, LLC, partnership, or S corp, this is the deduction on your business income that was set to expire at the end of 2025. It did not expire. There is also a new minimum deduction for anyone with at least a small amount of qualified business income.</li>
        <li><strong>Research costs are deductible again in the year you spend them</strong>, rather than spread over five years. Relevant if you develop products or software.</li>
        <li><strong>Meals you provide to employees for your own convenience are no longer deductible</strong> starting in 2026. They used to be half deductible. This is one of the few changes that goes the wrong way.</li>

While putting this page together we found accounting firm blog posts giving flatly contradictory figures for the same year, including wrong deduction percentages and outdated limits.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>2026 is confirmed at 100%.</strong> Property placed in service this year can be fully deducted. What happens in 2027 is not settled. A phase-down could resume, or Congress could extend it. Watch for legislation late this year.</li>
        <li><strong>"Placed in service" is the deadline, not "ordered."</strong> Equipment sitting in a crate on December 31 does not count. It has to be installed and ready to use.</li>
        <li><strong>Vehicles are their own mess.</strong> SUVs in the common weight range are capped at a much lower amount than other equipment. Pickups with a long cargo bed and cargo vans without rear seating generally are not. The weight rating on the sticker inside your driver's door is what decides it.</li>
        <li><strong>You need more than half business use</strong> for the vehicle to qualify at all, and your deduction is reduced to the business percentage.</li>
        <li><strong>Section 179 cannot create a loss.</strong> It is capped at your business income. Anything unused carries forward.</li>

        <p>What you should not do is buy something you did not need in order to get a deduction. A write-off gives you back a fraction of what you spent. Spending $40,000 to save $9,000 is still spending $31,000.</p>`,

To be deductible, an expense must be <strong>ordinary</strong>, meaning common and accepted in your line of work, and <strong>necessary</strong>, meaning helpful and appropriate.

      <p>Three things people consistently get wrong:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Meals versus entertainment.</strong> A meal with a client is generally half deductible. Tickets to a game or a round of golf are not deductible at all, and have not been for years. If the meal happens at the entertainment event, keep it on a separate receipt.</li>
        <li><strong>Meals for your own staff.</strong> Food you provide to employees for your convenience lost its deduction starting in 2026. If you have been feeding a crew and deducting half of it, that changed.</li>
        <li><strong>Records written after the fact.</strong> The single most common reason a deduction gets disallowed is documentation created later. Mileage logs, receipts, and a note of the business purpose need to be kept as you go. A reconstructed log is weak evidence.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>January 1.</strong> The assessment date. Whatever your property was worth that day is what the assessor is valuing, so that is the date your evidence has to speak to.</li>

          <li><strong>April 2 to April 25.</strong> Informal review with the assessor. This is the easy path. You call, they often walk the property, and if they agree you are done. Free, and no formal filing. Go early. Late requests can get denied simply for lack of time to review them.</li>

      <p>The state expects this law to cut property taxes by about $4.2 billion over six years. Here is what it actually does.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cities and counties can only grow their main budget by 2% a year. A few things are exempt, including school funding and some special levies. County hospitals get 4%. The bus system and emergency management get 3%.</li>
        <li>Cities and counties cannot keep more than 35% of their yearly spending in savings.</li>
        <li>Homeowners get a new discount of 10% off their taxable value, up to $20,000. This does not apply to commercial property.</li>
        <li>Apartment buildings become their own tax category in 2027. Their taxes go up about 6%, phased in over three years.</li>
        <li>TIF districts are now capped at 23 years. After year 20, the city can only use 60% of the money and cannot borrow against it.</li>
        <li>The Business Property Tax Credit stays at $150,000. But the $125 million the state used to send cities to make up the difference now goes into a state fund instead.</li>

        <p>About 90% of our property tax base is houses. Only about 10% is businesses. The city council has said its number one goal is bringing in more commercial development, so homeowners are not carrying so much of the load.</p>
        <p>Now here is the tension. Polk City is growing much faster than 2% a year. Every new house means more streets to plow, more water to treat, and more calls for police. But the money the city can collect is capped at 2%. Something has to give. Usually that shows up as slower projects, thinner services, or new fees.</p>
        <p>The TIF change matters even more. TIF is how a small city makes the numbers work on a commercial project. Shortening it to 23 years makes some of those deals harder to close. That is a direct hit to the exact goal the city is chasing.</p>
        <p>If you own an apartment building or a mixed use building, your taxes go up starting in 2027. Worth mentioning to your accountant before you set next year's budget.</p>`,

      <p>Since 1989, Polk County and Prairie Meadows have put more than $1.8 billion back into the community through grant programs. There are two related tracks.</p>
      <p><strong>Prairie Meadows grants.</strong> Community Betterment Grants run from $100 to $99,999 for small and medium projects. Legacy Grants run from $100,000 to $1 million for large signature projects. Applications typically open in December and close at the end of February. Categories include arts and culture, economic development, education, and health and human services.</p>
      <p><strong>Polk County Community Betterment Grants.</strong> Funded from the county's share of Prairie Meadows profits and awarded by the Board of Supervisors.</p>
      <p><strong>The eligibility catch.</strong> Applicants must be nonprofit, tax-exempt organizations. A for-profit business cannot apply directly. Organizations under religious management are not eligible for the county program under state law.</p>`,

Second, and more important, eligibility is not just about your town's population. Money has to go to areas outside the built-up edge of any city of 50,000 or more.

      <p>Some background worth having. Iowa's income tax is currently a flat 3.8%. Next year's state budget is $9.6 billion. It plans to spend about $1.2 billion more than it takes in, covered by drawing down a savings fund.</p>`,

Most people who work at Polk City businesses cannot afford to live here, so they commute. That makes it a hiring problem, not just a housing problem. If it is affecting your ability to staff up, tell us. Real examples from real members are what make the case.</p>`,
